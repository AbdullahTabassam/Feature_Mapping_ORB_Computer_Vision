# Computer Vision Feature Mapping Project

## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in computer vision techniques, specifically feature mapping, using the OpenCV library in Python. Feature mapping involves identifying distinctive features in images and matching them across different images or frames. Such techniques find applications in various fields including object detection, image retrieval, and augmented reality.

## Project Overview
The project utilizes the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detector and descriptor, a robust algorithm for feature extraction. It extracts features from a set of query images stored in a directory, then uses these features to identify objects in a live video stream captured through a webcam.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- NumPy
- Operating System (os) module

## How to Use
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Place the query images in a directory named 'ImagesQuery' within the project directory. Each image should represent a distinct object to be recognized.
3. Run the Python script provided.
4. A live video stream from the webcam will appear, and the script will attempt to identify objects in real-time.
5. Detected objects will be labeled on the video stream.

## Features
- **Modularity:** The project is modular, allowing easy extension and integration of additional features or algorithms.
- **Real-time Object Identification:** Utilizing feature mapping techniques, the script can identify objects in real-time from a webcam feed.
- **Robustness:** The ORB algorithm provides robust feature detection and matching, enabling reliable object recognition even in challenging conditions such as changes in lighting or viewpoint.

## Performance Considerations
- **Threshold Adjustment:** Fine-tuning the threshold parameter in the `findID()` function can improve the accuracy of object detection.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** To enhance performance, consider utilizing GPU acceleration for image processing tasks.

## Future Enhancements
- **Improved User Interface:** Enhance the user interface for better visualization of detected objects.
- **Integration with Deep Learning:** Explore integration with deep learning-based object detection models for improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Object Tracking:** Implement object tracking algorithms to track objects across consecutive frames.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of computer vision techniques for real-time object identification using feature mapping. With its modular design and robust feature detection capabilities, it serves as a solid foundation for further exploration and development in the field of computer vision.
